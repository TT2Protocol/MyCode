                What I am trying to make with htlm is novel website. I am thinking of the way to make my website popular.
            </p>
            <p>
                How can I get people to watch novels in my website? It is going to cost a lot of money to advertise my website on internet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://novelpia.com">Novelpia</a> is the <b>reason</b> why I determined to make a novel website myself. <br><br><br> But Novelpia had a company funding a lot of money for them. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                And they are still in the red. Part-time-job won't be enough to fund my novel website. Should I get in the company?
            </p>
            <p>
                A truly A&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp;X experience.
